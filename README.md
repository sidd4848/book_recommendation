# Book Recommendation System

This project provides a book recommendation system that suggests similar books based on the input book title. The recommendations are made by comparing the summary and categories of books, and the category similarity can be weighted using a slider. The system uses natural language processing (NLP) and semantic embeddings to generate recommendations.
